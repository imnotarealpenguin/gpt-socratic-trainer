# 🧠 GPT Socratic Trainer

An AI-powered self-learning tool that helps you master any topic by answering Socratic-style questions — instead of just reading summaries.

## 📚 What It Does

You choose a topic (e.g., neural networks, Roman history, or Stoic philosophy),  
and GPT-4 becomes your **Socratic tutor** — asking you a series of progressively deeper questions until you understand it on your own.

This tool flips traditional AI learning by turning **you** into the one who explains.

---

## 🔁 How It Works

1. You type your topic into `input/topic.txt`
2. The script prompts GPT to act like a Socratic teacher
3. It generates a guided question session
4. You answer the questions — and it adjusts based on what you say

## 🎯 Why I Built It

I’m obsessed with *true understanding*.  
This tool is my way of making GPT act like a thinking partner — not just an answer machine.

Inspired by ancient philosophers, optimized for modern learners.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- GPT-4 (prompt generation)
- Python (logic)
- Terminal input/output (MVP)

## ✍️ Sample Output

> **GPT**: What do you already know about neural networks?  
> **YOU**: I’ve heard of them but not sure how they work.  
> **GPT**: Interesting. Why do you think they’re called “neural”?  
> **YOU**: Maybe because they mimic the brain?  
> **GPT**: Exactly. Can you describe what a single neuron might do?
